Lyrics
=====

Lyrics were collected by the ethnomusicologists together with song melodies. 

There are less variations of lyrics in this corpus than variations of song melodies, because the corpus was focused mainly on the melodies (meaning sometimes for a variation of a song (which is designated by a 'v' letter in a song number) there is no corresponding lyrics variation, but the lyrics are given for the original song). 

The lyrics were scraped from the musicXML files and quality checked.
